2013 OpenLayers 3 Workshop
==========================

Welcome to the **OpenLayers 3 Workshop**. This workshop is designed to
give you a comprehensive overview of ol3 as a web mapping solution.  The
exercises assume that you have set up a local GeoServer with the workshop 
data as described in the :doc:`setup` page.

This workshop is presented as a set of modules. In each module the reader will
perform a set of tasks designed to achieve a specific goal for that module. Each
module builds upon lessons learned in previous modules and is designed to
iteratively build up the reader's knowledge base.

Note that the ol3 API is still in flux, and external links to the ol3 API documentation may not reflect the functionality available in this workshop.

The following modules will be covered in this workshop:

.. rubric:: Fundamentals
