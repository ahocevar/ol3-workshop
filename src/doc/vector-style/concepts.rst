Working with Vector Layers
==========================

The base ``ol.layer.Vector`` constructor provides a fairly flexible layer type. By default, when you create a new vector layer, no assumptions are made about where the features for the layer will come from, since this is the domain of ``ol.source.Vector``. Customizing the rendering style is addressed in an :ref:`upcoming section <openlayers.vector.style-intro>`. This section introduces the basics of vector data :ref:`formats <openlayers.vector.basics.format>`.

ol.format
---------

The ``ol.format`` classes in OpenLayers 3 are responsible for parsing data from the server representing vector features. Most of the times you won't be using them directly, but you'll be using their corresponding source (e.g. ``ol.source.KML``). The format turns raw feature data into ``ol.Feature`` objects.

Consider the two blocks of data below. Both represent the same ``ol.Feature`` object (a point in Barcelona, Spain). The first is serialized as `GeoJSON <http://geojson.org>`_ (using the ``ol.format.GeoJSON`` parser). The second is serialized as :abbr:`KML (OGC Keyhole Markup Language)` (using the ``ol.format.KML`` parser).


GeoJSON Example
```````````````

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "type": "Feature",
        "id": "OpenLayers.Feature.Vector_107",
        "properties": {},
        "geometry": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [-104.98, 39.76] 
        }
    }


KML Example
```````````

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <kml xmlns="http://earth.google.com/kml/2.2">
      <Placemark>
        <Point>
          <coordinates>-104.98,39.76</coordinates>
        </Point>
      </Placemark>
    </kml>
